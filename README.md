## Background
Hi there! üëã Here comes your interview assignment where you will build an Account Management API.

To understand how it is supposed to work please refer to the [Test Specification](#test-specification) that provides the necessary background.

Before you start, please read through the [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria) as they define the requirements of this assignment.
 
As this setup simulates a real-world task, feel free to use any resources that you'd normally use to complete it.

Best of luck! üçÄ

## Acceptance Criteria
* The API must be implemented using the .NET stack on a new branch so that all [API Tests](#running-api-tests) pass.
* A key-value in-memory data store must be used for storing and accessing data.
* The data must be strongly consistent at any point in time.
* Submit a [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html) with your implementation when you're done.
